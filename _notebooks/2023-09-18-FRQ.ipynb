    "\n",
    "1. We first import the ArrayList utility.\n",
    "2. Define the Digits class.\n",
    "3. Initialize an ArrayList called digitList which will store the digits of a given number.\n",
    "4. The constructor (Digits(int num)) populates the digitList based on the given number.\n",
    "5. The isStrictlyIncreasing method checks if the digits in digitList are in strictly increasing order.\n",
    "6. Finally, a main method has been added to test our class. It creates a few instances of the Digits class and checks if the numbers are strictly increasing."

    "## Challenges\n",
    "1. Extracting Digits: At first, I didn't know how to get each digit from a number. I thought about changing the number into words and looking at each letter, but using the % operation seemed smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Starting the List: I was confused about where to start the digitList. Should I do it right at the beginning or when I make a new number? I decided to do it when I make a new number so it's fresh each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  I forgot about the number 0. When I tried it, nothing happened! So, I added a special rule just for zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Order Matters: In my first try, I only looked if numbers were the same. But then I realized some numbers could be smaller than the one before. I changed my rules to check that.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Getting the Order Right: I was putting numbers at the end of my list, but they were backward! I had to fix it by putting them at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Fast or Slow?: I wondered if my list was slow because I kept adding numbers to the start. I thought about another type of list but kept the one I had. I figured it's okay since we're not looking at super long numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Testing: I checked if my code worked, and some numbers were wrong! I had to go back and look at my rules again.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Using the Main Method: I didn't know how to see if my code was right. After looking it up, I learned about the main method and used that.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Writing Comments: I wasn't sure how much to write about my code. I wanted to explain things, but not too much."
