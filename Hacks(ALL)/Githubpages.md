            Shell Commands Used in Installation Procedure:
            <br>
            1. wsl: Windows Subsystem for Linux command, which lets you run a Linux distribution on Windows.
            cd: Stands for "change directory". It is used to navigate between folders.
            git: It is a distributed version control system. Various commands such as git clone, git pull, and git push allow for interactions with repositories.
            apt: A package manager used in Debian-based Linux distributions for installing and managing software.
            brew: A package manager for macOS (and also available on Linux) that installs software packages.
            Version Control:
            <br>
            2. Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later. 
            <br>
            3. Files from GitHub are placed in the directory where you run the git clone command. To navigate to these files, you can use the cd command followed by the repository's name.
            GitHub Files in the Cloud:
            <br>
            4. The files are stored in repositories on GitHub's servers. You navigate to those files by visiting the specific repository URL on GitHub, which usually follows the pattern https://github.com/username/repository-name.
            Updating a Template or Fork:
            <br>
            5. If the teacher updates the original repository and I want to get those updates in my forked repository, I'd use the git pull command to fetch and merge changes from the upstream repository. The difference between viewing GitHub Pages on a localhost and a deployed server is that on localhost, it's only accessible to me on my machine, whereas on a deployed server (like GitHub Pages), it's accessible to anyone with the URL.
            Localhost URL:
            <br>
            6. The localhost URL for my distribution is typically http://localhost:PORT/ (with PORT being the specific port number). Only I can see it when running on my machine.
            GitHub Pages URL:
            <br>
            7. The GitHub Pages URL for my distribution would be https://username.github.io/repository-name/. Anyone with the URL can view it.
            Changing Domain Name of Repository:
            <br>
            8. To change the domain name of my student repository, I navigated to the repository settings on GitHub and used the "Custom domain" option. By inputting my custom domain and ensuring my DNS settings were correctly pointing to GitHub Pages, I was able to assign a personalized URL to my repository. I essentially changed the address, allowing users to access my repository using that custom domain instead of the default GitHub Pages URL.
