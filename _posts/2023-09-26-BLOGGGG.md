# Collaboration with Crossover Team
 
## What Went Well:
- **Code Functionality and Runtime Proof:** My code was not only functional but also efficient in its runtime. This ensured that the solutions provided were both correct and optimized.
- **Comparison with Scoring Guidelines:** I meticulously compared my code with the scoring guidelines to ensure that all requirements were met, ensuring a high-quality submission.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** I provided a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough, detailing how I tackled the problem, which gave clarity to my thought process.

## Areas for Improvement:
- **Code Explanation and Comments:** While my code was functional, it lacked sufficient comments and explanations, making it challenging for others to understand the logic behind it.
- **Understanding the Question:** I realized that I needed to delve deeper into understanding the problem statement to provide a more accurate solution.

## Steps Taken for Improvement:
- **Educational Resources:** I took the initiative to watch a tutorial video by AP Collegeboard, which provided valuable insights into the problem-solving approach.
- **Peer Collaboration:** By discussing and comparing solutions with my classmates, I gained a broader perspective and understood different approaches to the problem.
- **Feedback Gathering:** I presented my solution to a wider audience, seeking their feedback and suggestions, which greatly helped in refining my approach.

## Peer Crossover Grading for FRQ:

- **Kevin:**
